Data Summary:
- This data set is of 9953 images of 10 species of plants (5
poisonous and 5 nonpoisonous) scraped from the iNaturalist network [1]. There
are approximately 1000 images of each species. While the data is hosted on
Kaggle, it is scraped straight from iNaturalist, cited in other works, and we could
not obtain these images through another reasonable method.

Provenance:
- This data set was put together by Hans Elliot and updated 3 years
ago with iNaturalist data. The dataset was originally made with Google image
scraping, but was replaced with iNaturalist images for better accuracy.

License:
- This data has a CC0 Public Domain license, which means that all
copyright and database rights have been waived.

Ethical Statements:
- This project uses images that were publicly available on
iNaturalist, and there is no personal information of any individuals associated
with these images. Thus, there are no clear ethical harms from utilizing this data.
